# SleepingDragon
SleepingDragon game, HTML and windows/linux executable files!




HOW TO PLAY:
You are playing as the Knight. Your knight starts at the left of the screen, and you must input a correct answer to progress across the screen, by the dragon.
The dragon will take her turn first, showing a single object she's dreaming of. You must type in what you think BEST describes the object WITHOUT using the keyword listed above. There are only 5 correct answers for each one, so think carefully, don't think TOO outside the box!
After you input your answer, the dragon will judge whether or not she likes the answer with a thumbs up or down.
You also only have one life, so make it count!
The dragon will give progressively more difficult questions as the game continues. You win when the knight makes it to the other side of the screen and runs off!
